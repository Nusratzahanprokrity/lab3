<h1>Style of the Extraordinary</h1>
<p>shopping mall is a modern North American term for a form of a
shopping center or shopping precinct. This is a building in a complex where more than one
shops represent different merchandisers that have interconnecting walkways. This enables
the customers to walk from one unit to another without a need to move to a new
building.</p>

<h1>About us:</h1>
<p>Many early shopping centers such as London’s Burlington Arcade,
Milan’s Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II and various others in Paris are still trading and are very
famous. However, there are various smaller arcades, that have been demolished and been
replaced by large centers of malls, which are accessible, by vehicle. Escalators and Electric
Lightning technological innovations were introduced in the 19th century in shopping
malls.</p>
